# Lecture 1

## What was discussed

All course information can be found at [MIF VMA Software engineering course (2025)](https://emokymai.vu.lt/course/view.php?id=2446)

## Team Homework

📋 **Action Required**: Teams must complete the initial setup tasks outlined in the [TODO-LIST.md](TODO-LIST.md)

This includes deciding on your team structure, application theme, technology stack, and setting up your development environment.

### Teams Setup

- All assignments will be done in **teams of 4-5 people**
- Teams will be responsible for developing an application to solve one of the selected problems

### Weekly Evaluation Process

Each week, teams participate in a peer evaluation process:

1. **Demo Presentation**: Each team demonstrates what changed during the last week (application updates, code changes, task distribution, etc.)

2. **Peer Evaluation**: Team members evaluate each other's contributions
   - Each team member has **X points** to distribute, where X = team members count + 1
   - You must rationalize why you're giving specific points to each team member
   - Points can be split by half (e.g., 1.5 points), but no smaller increments

#### Evaluation Example

**Scenario**: Team of 4 people, so each person has 5 points to distribute

**My point distribution**:
- **2.0 points** to myself - worked on many features and helped others
- **1.5 points** to colleague - implemented dependency injection
- **1.0 point** to teammate - created a couple of new classes and structs  
- **0.5 points** to teammate - joined discussions, attempted implementation but failed to commit

Every team member votes, and the lecturer enters the final totals into the evaluation sheet.

### Assignment Deadlines & Evaluation

#### Late Submission Penalty
- **20% reduction** in maximum mark for each week late

#### Evaluation Process

**Example scenario**: Week 7 arrives, first assignment deadline

1. **Demo Presentation**
   - Teams demonstrate their application
   - Each deadline is treated like a **Scrum sprint**
   - Must present fully working functionality for implemented features
   - Application evolves: Alpha → Beta → Final versions
   - Even intermediate deadlines require working partial functionality

2. **Requirements Review**
   - Lecturer checks if requirements are fulfilled
   - May ask individual questions to verify knowledge (affects individual marks)
   - **Minimum expectation**: 75% of requirements implemented
   - Quality of implementation matters

3. **Final Scoring**
   - Points from week 1 to current week are summarized
   - Highest scorer gets maximum evaluation
   - Others scored proportionally
   - Close scores may both receive maximum evaluation

4. **Quality Assessment**
   - Lecturer may cap maximum possible mark (e.g., "70% max due to missing X and Y")
   - Teams can disagree and return next week with requested fixes
