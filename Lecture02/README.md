# Lecture 2

## What was discussed

This lecture focused on setting up a full-stack web application using React (frontend) and ASP.NET Core (backend), understanding client-server communication, and exploring RESTful API principles.

## Topics Covered

### React + ASP.NET Core Project Setup

Learn how to create and configure a modern web application stack (using template project):

- **Frontend**: React application for user interface
- **Backend**: ASP.NET Core Web API for server-side logic
- **Integration**: Connecting React frontend with ASP.NET Core backend
- **Project structure** and organization for full-stack development

### Client-Server Communication

Understanding how frontend and backend communicate:

- **HTTP requests** from React to ASP.NET Core API
- **Data flow** between client and server
- **Asynchronous communication** patterns
- **Error handling** and response management

### RESTful API Principles

Introduction to REST (Representational State Transfer):

- **HTTP methods**: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE
- **Resource-based URLs** and endpoint design
- **Status codes** and their meanings
- **Request/Response** structure and data formats
- **Best practices** for API design

### API Testing with Postman

Hands-on demonstration of API testing:

- **Creating and organizing** API requests
- **Testing different HTTP methods** and endpoints
- **Working with request headers** and body data
- **Analyzing responses** and status codes
- **Building test collections** for API validation

## Code Examples & Tutorials

### Step-by-Step Implementation

For detailed code examples and step-by-step instructions demonstrated during the lecture:

**Reference Repository**: [PSI2025-Playground - Lecture 02](https://github.com/niku-live/PSI2025-Playground/tree/lectures/02)

This branch contains:
- Complete React + ASP.NET Core project setup
- Sample API endpoints and React components
- Configuration files and project structure
- Examples of HTTP requests and responses
- Postman collection for API testing

### What You'll Find

- **Project templates** for React and ASP.NET Core
- **Example API controllers** with CRUD operations
- **React components** for consuming API data
- **Configuration examples** for CORS, routing, and middleware
- **Sample data models** and DTOs (Data Transfer Objects)
- **Postman collection** with pre-configured API requests

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the examples**: Access the [lecture branch](https://github.com/niku-live/PSI2025-Playground/tree/lectures/02)
2. **Follow the setup guide**: Step-by-step instructions in the repository
3. **Run both projects**: Start ASP.NET Core backend and React frontend
4. **Test the API**: Use Postman or browser to verify communication
5. **Experiment**: Modify code to understand the concepts better

## Key Takeaways

- **Full-stack development** requires understanding both frontend and backend technologies
- **RESTful APIs** provide a standard way for applications to communicate
- **Proper project structure** is essential for maintainable applications
- **API testing tools** like Postman are crucial for development workflow
- **Client-server communication** follows predictable patterns and protocols

## Next Steps

- Practice creating your own React components that consume API data
- Experiment with different HTTP methods and status codes
- Build a simple CRUD application using the demonstrated technologies
- Explore additional ASP.NET Core features like dependency injection and middleware
