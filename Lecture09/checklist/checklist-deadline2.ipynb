    "- 👥 **Every** team member knows what Dependency Injection and Inversion of Control (IoC) are.\n",
    "- 👥 **Every** team member knows different DI lifetimes (Singleton, Transient, Scoped) and when to use each.\n",

Meaningful usage includes proper service layer separation, repository patterns, and configuration management. Focus on constructor injection, appropriate lifetimes, and avoiding service locator anti-pattern - minimize direct 'new' usage and embrace dependency inversion principle.\n",
    "\n",
    "📝 **DI implementation guidelines**:\n",
    "- **Don't**: Use the Service Locator pattern (asking the container for dependencies within your classes)\n",
    "- **Don't**: Create dependencies with `new` operator when they have their own dependencies\n",
    "- **Don't**: Register everything as Singleton without understanding the implications\n",
    "- **Don't**: Use property injection when constructor injection is possible\n",
    "- **Do**: Use constructor injection as the primary pattern\n",
    "- **Do**: Register interfaces, not concrete types in most cases\n",

    "- **Do**: Keep constructors simple - only assign injected dependencies, no business logic\n",
    "\n",
    "⚡ **Performance Considerations**:\n",
    "- Singleton services are created once and reused - ensure they are thread-safe\n",
    "- Transient services are created every time - avoid for heavy objects without good reason\n",
    "- Scoped services balance performance and isolation for web applications\n",
    "- Consider factory patterns for expensive object creation\n",
    "- Monitor memory usage with singleton services that hold state\n",
    "\n",
    "🔧 **Common Troubleshooting**:\n",
    "- **Circular Dependencies**: Refactor to use interfaces or extract common dependencies\n",
    "- **Disposal Issues**: Ensure proper IDisposable implementation for scoped/transient services\n",
    "- **Missing Registrations**: Check service registration, interface naming, and assembly scanning\n",
    "- **Lifetime Conflicts**: Verify that longer-lived services don't depend on shorter-lived ones\n",
