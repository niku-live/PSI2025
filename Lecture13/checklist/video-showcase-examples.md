## **Video Structure Guidelines**

### Effective 4-6 minute videos typically follow this structure:
1. **Hook (0-15 seconds)**: Problem statement or compelling demo moment
2. **Problem (15-45 seconds)**: What problem does this solve?
3. **Solution Demo (2-4 minutes)**: Core functionality walkthrough
4. **Value Proposition (30-60 seconds)**: Why this matters, who benefits

### **Content Guidelines**
- **Show, don't tell**: Demonstrate actual functionality rather than explaining concepts
- **User perspective**: Show the application from the end-user's viewpoint
- **Clean data**: Use realistic but clean test data for demonstrations
- **Smooth flow**: Practice transitions between features to avoid awkward pauses
- **Audio quality**: Clear narration is crucial - consider using external microphone

### **Technical Tips**
- **Screen recording tools**: OBS Studio (free), Camtasia, Loom for high-quality demos
- **Video editing**: DaVinci Resolve (free), Adobe Premiere Pro, Final Cut Pro
- **Presentation skills**: Study TED Talks for storytelling and engagement techniques
- **Backup plans**: Have screenshots ready in case live demo fails

### **Common Mistakes to Avoid**
- ❌ **Too much code**: Don't spend time showing code unless it's particularly innovative
- ❌ **Technical jargon**: Keep language accessible to non-technical viewers
- ❌ **Long setup**: Jump straight to the interesting parts
- ❌ **Poor audio**: Viewers will tolerate poor video quality but not poor audio
- ❌ **No clear narrative**: Make sure there's a story connecting all the features

## **Platform-Specific Tips**

### **For Web Applications**
- Use full-screen browser view
- Show responsive design on different screen sizes
- Demonstrate key user workflows from start to finish
- Highlight unique features that differentiate your app

### **For Mobile Applications**
- Use device simulators or screen mirroring for clarity
- Show touch interactions clearly
- Demonstrate both portrait and landscape orientations
- Include app store screenshots if published

### **For Desktop Applications**
- Show installation or setup process briefly
- Demonstrate cross-platform compatibility if applicable
- Highlight system integration features
- Show performance benefits with real data
